This example app tracks labor based on the work reqester, the worker and the customer. It is designed to allow metadata processing servers to be the primary 
means of tracking work and validating work.

Specifically the app expects to recieve information from the XRP, BTC, ETH, ONT, and ONG markets as well as other big data providers.

It allows employers to register and post work requests. 

The app allows workers to register and to accept work requests. 

It then allows workers to close work requests. 

The app expects the rest to be done on a remote server. 

In summery the app needs to allow workers to register. Workers need to be able to use the app to input their work availability in terms of which days and which hours they are able to work. 

The following is a brief business analyst perspective of the app: 
------------------------------------------------------------------

The app then needs to wait for a remote server to assign a given worker a set number of hours of work (1 hour by default). The app then needs to receive a basic identifier unique to the employer from a remote server. When the work request is received the app needs to assign it to a worker. The worker must accept the work request. The worker must then perform the task the app has assigned it in the real world while a series of remote systems collect their metadata. The app then needs to allow the worker to tell it when the job is completed. When the worker tells it the job is completed the remote server will request payment from the work recipient or employer. The worker can then tell the app where to send their payment. The app will tell the remote server where to send the payment. The remote server should then send the payment. The remote server should then post a message to the workers account which tells them that they should have received payment.

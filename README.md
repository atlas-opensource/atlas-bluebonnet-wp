This example app tracks labor based on the work reqester, the worker and the customer. It is designed to allow metadata processing servers to be the primary 
means of tracking work and validating work on a remote server. Specifically the app expects to recieve information from the XRP, BTC, ETH, ONT, and ONG markets.
The app allows workers to register and to accept work requests. It then allows them to close work requests. The app expects the rest to be done on the remote end.

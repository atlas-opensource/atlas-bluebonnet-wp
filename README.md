This example app tracks labor based on the work reqester or employer, a data source and a worker. It is designed to allow metadata processing systems and public ledgers like blockchains, to be the primary means of tracking work and validating work.

Specifically the app expects to recieve information from the XRP, BTC, ETH, ONT, and ONG markets as well as other big data providers.

It allows employers to register and post work requests. 

The app allows workers to register and to accept work requests. 

It then allows workers to close work requests. 

The app then verifies that the task has been completed using purchasable metadta, public ledger data (blockchain) or other metadata sources.
 

The following is a brief business analyst perspective of the app: 
------------------------------------------------------------------

The app needs to wait for a remote server to assign a given worker a set number of hours of work (1 hour by default). The app needs to receive a basic identifier unique to the employer from a remote server. When the work request is received the app needs to assign it to a worker. The worker must accept the work request. The worker must then perform the task the app has assigned it in the real world while a series of remote systems collect their metadata. The app then needs to allow the worker to tell it when the job is completed. When the worker tells it the job is completed the remote server will request payment from the work recipient or employer. The worker can then tell the app where to send their payment. The app will tell the employer where to send the payment. The app then allows the employer to post payment to the worker's specified account. The app then posts a message notifying the worker that their payment has been posted.
